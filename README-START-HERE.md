## 📁 NEW FILES CREATED

I've added these files to your `etel-os` folder:

- **`etel-engine.js`** - AI engine (already updated)
- **`CODE-TO-ADD.html`** - Code to add to your index.html

### Documentation:
- **`README-START-HERE.md`** - This file (read first!)
- **`SETUP-NOW.txt`** - Quick setup checklist

## 🎯 SETUP IN 3 STEPS (15 MINUTES)

### STEP 1: Install Ollama (5 minutes)

Open **Command Prompt** (cmd) and run:

```cmd
winget install Ollama.Ollama
```

Then download a model:

```cmd
ollama pull llama3
```

Start the server (keep this window open):

```cmd
ollama serve
```

✅ **Done!** Ollama is running on your PC.

---

### STEP 2: Update index.html (5 minutes)

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor
2. Find the `</body>` tag (near the end)
3. **BEFORE** `</body>`, add this:

```html
<!-- ETEL Configuration -->
<script src="config.js"></script>

<!-- ETEL Engine -->
<script src="etel-engine.js"></script>

<!-- ETEL Initialization -->
<script>
// Copy ALL the code from CODE-TO-ADD.html
// (It's a complete script - about 300 lines)
</script>
```

**OR** just copy everything from `CODE-TO-ADD.html` and paste it before `</body>`

4. Save `index.html`

✅ **Done!** Your HTML is ready.

---

### STEP 3: Upload to Your Server (5 minutes)

Upload these files to `ethelmarket.com/etel/`:

```
✓ index.html (updated)
✓ etel-engine.js
✓ config.js (NEW)
✓ manifest.json
✓ sw.js
✓ skills/registry.json
✓ icons/icon-192.png
✓ icons/icon-512.png
```

**Your `api/api.php` is already there, so skip that.**

**How to upload:**
- Use cPanel File Manager, OR
- Use FTP (FileZilla), OR
- Use your hosting control panel

✅ **Done!** Files are uploaded.

---

## 🧪 TEST IT!

1. **Make sure Ollama is running:**
   ```cmd
   ollama serve
   ```

2. **Open your ETEL:**
   ```
   https://ethelmarket.com/etel/
   ```

3. **Open DevTools (F12) → Console**
   
   Should see:
   ```
   ✅ ETEL Engine initialized
   📊 Skills loaded: 27
   ```

4. **Test AI:**
   
   Type in chat:
   ```
   Write Python code to print hello world
   ```
   
   Should get **real AI response**!

✅ **Working? YOU'RE DONE!** 🎉
